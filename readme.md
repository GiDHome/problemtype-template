# GiD problemtype template
This is an empty shell of a problemtype for GiD. Use it to create your own.

Remember to:
- Change the name: the name.gid must be the same as name.tcl, name.spd, name.win.bat, name.xml...
- Change the namespace: Inside name.tcl, you can find a namespace. Change it to your name.
- Check the documentation in [Customization Manual](https://www.gidsimulation.com/gid-for-science/support/manuals/)

Good luck
